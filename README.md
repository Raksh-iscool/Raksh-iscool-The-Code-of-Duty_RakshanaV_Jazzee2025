# Tellie – GenAI Storytelling & Learning Assistant

Tellie is a GenAI-powered mobile app that transforms how children engage with stories and lessons. By combining the power of LLMs and voice cloning, Tellie allows kids to choose their favorite character (like Doraemon, Olaf, or Iron Man) to explain or narrate content in a fun, personalized, and emotionally engaging way.


##  Overview

**What if Iron Man taught photosynthesis or Dora explained history like a story?**

Tellie makes that possible. It uses generative AI and voice synthesis to make learning magical and emotionally memorable. Whether it’s a lesson or a bedtime story, kids can:

* Upload content or pick a preloaded story
* Choose a favorite character
* Get content rewritten in the character's tone
* And even hear it narrated in the character's voice

The app is fun, accessible, and supports multiple languages — making education personal and delightful.
## Features
 * Character-based Explanation: Upload a story or lesson, choose a character, and get the content rewritten in the character’s tone and style.
 * Voice Narration (TTS): Narration is generated in the voice of the chosen character using voice cloning APIs.
 * Multilingual Support: Basic support for Hindi, Tamil, and English.
 * Chat-Style UI: Interactive chat or story output delivered through a Flutter app.
